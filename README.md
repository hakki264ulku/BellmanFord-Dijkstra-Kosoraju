# ⭐ BellmanFord-Dijkstra-Kosoraju
* Live (See the application running): https://bellmanford-dijkstra-kosoraju.web.app/
* This application is built to simulate Bellman Ford, Dijkstra and Kosoraju algorithms.

# ❔ Idea Behind The Project
* Bellman Ford can calculate the shortest path from a given source to every other vertex on the graph. Difference of this from Dijsktra is that this can work with negative weights.

* Dijsktra can calculate the shortest path from a given source to every other vertex on the graph.

* Kosaraju can find the strongly connected components which are the vertex sets where every node is reachable from other nodes in that set.

# 🚀 Tech Stack
* JavaScript
* ReactJS
* TailwindCss
